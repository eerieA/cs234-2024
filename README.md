This repo contains Stanford CS234 **2024 spring** assignment's coding problems (as claimed by the original repo owner), and some personally taken notes after watching the [free video lectures on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rN4wG6Nk6sNpTEbuOSosZdX). The official course website is [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/), which contains entire course materials for the **latest** offering, for example, winter 2025. So please be advised that the assignments here might not match the latest course material exactly.

Feel free to follow the instructions in each problem directory to run and test it.
